# ü™ê MCore
GitHub page of Russian project **MCore**.
## Topic
MCore - semi-vanilla Minecraft server, working on last versions.
## Our goals
Our main purpose - make a open-source technological and friendly project without a toxic community.
## Community
We want adequate players who respect other people to play on our server.
We will try to restrict access to the project to those whose behavior we consider unacceptable.
## When the server will be opened?
It's impossible to give exact figures, but we are guided by the opening within one year.
Right now, we have been actively developing the server since the end of May 2022.
## More info
To get on the server you will need to submit an application
in future, which will be considered by the project administration.
Server is cracked, there's also no age limit. Why?
Oh yeah, also to play on the server you must have [Discord](https://discord.com/login) account.

By the way, at first time this server will be open only for the Russian community.
Over time, we will try to open the server to people from all over the world.
